# Multiple-selectors
This app was adapted from [Optimum Study Dashboard](https://biostat.wustl.edu/seminars/YZhong_Feb2118.pdf) for testing multiple selectors and DT table interactivity.
The cells (record_id) in DT table serves as input for updating the selection of multiple dropdown menus (selectInput).
